            <li>Vegetable oil for the pans</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red food coloring (1 ounce)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white distilled vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese Frosting, recipe follows</li>
            <li>Crushed pecans, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Cream Cheese Frosting: </em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>2 sticks unsalted butter (1 cup), softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil and flour three 9 by 1 1/2-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder. <br>
            In another large bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Using a standing mixer, mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined and a smooth batter is formed.</li>
        <li>Divide the cake batter evenly among the prepared cake pans. Place the pans in the oven evenly spaced apart. <br>
            Bake, rotating the pans halfway through the cooking, until the cake pulls away from the side of the pans, and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans. 
            <br>One at a time, invert the cakes onto a plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up. 
            <br>Let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Frost the cake. Place 1 layer, rounded-side down, in the middle of a rotating cake stand. Using a palette knife or offset spatula spread some of the Cream Cheese Frosting over the top of the cake. (Spread enough frosting to make a 1/4 to 1/2-inch layer.) Carefully set another layer on top, rounded-side down, and repeat. <br>
            Top with the remaining layer and cover the entire cake with the remaining frosting. <br>
            Sprinkle the top with the pecans.</li>
        <h3><em>Cream Cheese Frosting: </em></h3>
        <p><strong>Yield:</strong>enough to frost a 3 layer (9-inch) cake</p>
        <li>In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-held electric mixer in a large bowl, mix the cream cheese, sugar, and butter on low speed until incorporated. Increase the speed to high, and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. 
            <br>(Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.)</li>
        <li>Reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Add the vanilla, raise the speed to high and mix briefly until fluffy (scrape down the bowl occasionally). 
            <br>Store in the refrigerator until somewhat stiff, before using. May be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.</li>
    </ol>
